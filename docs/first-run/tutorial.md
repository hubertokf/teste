# Tutorial Completion
## RocketMap's tutorial completion for new accounts
RocketMap now completes the tutorial steps on all accounts on first log in, there is no more `-tut` argument to complete the tutorial.
It's recommended to enable pokestop spinning in the config to get your accounts to level 2.
